%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

Our goal is to write program which recongnizes handwritten mathematical expressions.
We made several milestones to solve this hard problem.
We are going to using ANN algorithm basically to solve this problem.

\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Problem}

Writing mathematical expressions in a computer readable format is difficult and requires a lot of efforts to get used to.
For example, the \LaTeX syntax requires a lot of cumbersome notations. \verb'\frac{3}{5}' for $\frac{3}{5}$, \verb'\sum_{i=0}^{10}{i \times 3}' for $\sum_{i=0}^{10}{i \times 3}$.

We will recognize handwritten mathematical expressions by image processing.
We will also try to calculate the value of the expression after the recognition.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Goal}

Our goal is to make a recognizer for handwritten mathematical expressions. We will also calculate the recognized expressions and show the results if possible.

It is difficult to recognize arbitrary mathematical expressions at first, so we made some milestones of our goal.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The expression contains only digits and some arithmetic operators. \\
e.g.) $765+573-25252$

\item The expression contains parentheses. \\
e.g.) $(301-314)\times 147$

\item The expression contains numbers with a decimal point. \\
e.g.) $147.46 + 147.47 - 4.30 \times 18$

\item The expression contains pi and trigonometrical functions. \\
e.g.) $\sin \pi + \cot (\pi / 4)$

\item The expression contains fractions and some mathematical symbols. \\
e.g.) $$ \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$

\item The expression contains sigma(summation) symbols and integration symbols. \\
e.g.) $$ \sum_{i=0}^{5} i \times 2 $$

\end{enumerate}

\section{Previous Works}
`Character segmentation in handwritten words â€” An overview'
\cite{Lu199677} summarizes various methods used in segmenting hand-written characters.
Some algorithms are based on tracking important contour features.
Others depend on recognition algorithm,
which calculates likelihood score to be isolated symbols,
and repeats merging and separating.

`Neural Networks and Deep Learning' \cite{MichaelNielsen} shows basic technique to recognize hand-written digits using Artificial Neural Network.

There was a similar student project `OCR of Math Expressions'\cite{OCRMATH}.
They used printed mathematical expressions as input.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Methods}

The proposed problem might be solved in several stages:
character segmentation, character recognition, and calculating final results.

The first stage `character segmentation' is to detect characters and to output each character region.
This is probably the most challenging part, therefore we will not address the segmentation issue here.
We will just assume the segmentation is done already. 

For the next stage `character recognition',
we will apply convolutional neural network to recognize each symbol in an expression.
We also have to consider context to get proper expression. For example, $\sin \pi$ is much more likely to appear in the expression than $51n \pi$. Markov chain might be used to determine the probabilities.

Finally, we will calculate the expressions based on the results of the prior stages.
